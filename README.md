# CoViz-Covid-Data-Visualization
Through the interactive features, the user can change color schemes as well as the date of the Covid cases represented in the maps. The project automatically populates two choropleths at once: The first one is on the linear scale while the second one is on the quantile scale. Notice how the same data can be perceived differently depending on the type of scale and the color scheme chosen. This demonstrates the importance of viewing data visualizations within the context of what it attempts to show. In other words, as consumers of data visualization, we should always be conscious of the narrative the author wants to tell through the visualization, and compare it with the facts we read in the news, media, etc. And as engineers and data scientists creating these visualizations, we have the responsibility to not only use legitimate datasets but also represent that data as truthfully as possible.
